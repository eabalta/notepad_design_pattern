# Object Oriented Programming
## Project-2:
- I have to prepare a text editor by using design patterns.
### Requirements:
1. You have to use "Command" pattern for undo.
2. Use the "Iterator" pattern implementation that is available in Java environment where iteration is required.
3. Use two more design patterns other than "Singleton".

- I have coded this project by using Command, Iterator, Strategy and Abstract Factory Patterns.
